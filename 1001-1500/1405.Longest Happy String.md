# **Pattern behind this question**
* Reduce the problem to a problem with the same description but smaller imput size.

# **The intuation is simple**

* If the a == b == c, then the problem is simple. We can just return `"abcabcabc..."`.
* To make the string as long as possible, we should first use the letter that remains most -- this strategy also leads us closer to the scenario where a == b == c.

# **Idea**

Without loss of generality, let\'s suppose `a <= b <= c`. There are four cases:
* a < b < c
* a < b == c
* a == b < c
* a == b == c

To handle them:
* if b == 0, that means there are only some "c"s remaining. Append as many as you can (either `""`, `"c"`, or `"cc"`).
* elss if b == c, that means we can append `"cb"` then append the recursive solution of the remaining `a,b,c`.
* else, that means c > b >= a. So we can append `"ccb"` then append the recursive solution of the remaining `a,b,c`.

# **Homework for readers**
* prove that this algorithm won\'t come up with a substring of 3 consecutive same letters. (Hint: enumerate the possible remaining `a,b,c` after applying the algorithm to the "four cases".)

# **Python code**
```
class Solution(object):
    def longestDiverseString(self, a, b, c, a_chr="a", b_chr="b", c_chr="c"):
        if not (a <= b <= c):
            data = sorted([(a, a_chr), (b, b_chr), (c, c_chr)])
            return self.longestDiverseString(data[0][0], data[1][0], data[2][0], data[0][1], data[1][1], data[2][1])
        if b == 0:
            return c_chr * min(2, c)
        if b == c:
            return c_chr + b_chr + self.longestDiverseString(a, b - 1, c - 1, a_chr, b_chr, c_chr)
        return c_chr * 2 + b_chr + self.longestDiverseString(a, b - 1, c - 2, a_chr, b_chr, c_chr)
