```
class Solution(object):
    def canThreePartsEqualSum(self, A):
        s = sum(A)
        if s % 3 != 0:
            return False
        s /= 3
        targets = [2 * s, s]
        acc = 0
        for a in A:
            if not targets:
                return True
            acc += a
            if acc == targets[-1]:
                targets.pop()
        return False
```

Edit:

Thanks for @rikiyasuzuki \'s reminder. rikiyasuzuki found a bug in my code (as well as in the judge). The `if not targets: return True` was after `targets.pop()`, which returned `true` for the testcase `[1, -1, 1, -1]`. Currently the LeetCode judge also returns `true` incorrectly.
