The alogrithm is simple:
* `dfs(node, cost)` returns the probability of staying at `target` in `t` seconds **given that** the frog is already at `node` and has spent `cost` seconds on this path.
* If `target` is not seen during the dfs search, return `None`.

The math behind it is `P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B | A)`.
* A means "The frog is at `node`"
* B means "The frog is at `target` in `t` seconds"
* The graph is a tree so there is exactly one path to `target`. So the probability of getting to target in t seconds is equal to the probability of going to a and then b and then c and ... and finally target within `t` seconds, where a, b, c, ... are the nodes on the path to `target`.

Some if-else logic in the code can be simplified. But I won\'t like to keep it longer for clear logic.
```
import collections
class Solution(object):
    def frogPosition(self, n, edges, t, target):
	    # make graph
        graph = collections.defaultdict(set)
        for u, v in edges:
            graph[u].add(v)
            graph[v].add(u)
		
        def dfs(node, cost):
            if cost > t:
                return None
            if node == target:
                if graph[node]:
                    if cost != t:
                        return 0.0
                    else:
                        return 1.0
                else:
                    return 1.0
            else:
                for neighbor in graph[node]:
                    graph[neighbor].discard(node)
                    res = dfs(neighbor, cost + 1)
                    if res is not None:
                        return res / len(graph[node])
                return None
        return dfs(1, 0) or 0
