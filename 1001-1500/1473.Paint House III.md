`dp(i, color, target)` returns the minimum cost to paint the first `i + 1` houses under the constraints that
* there are `target` many neighborhoods among the the first `i + 1` houses
* and the house[i] is painted with color `color`


```
from functools import lru_cache
class Solution:
    def minCost(self, houses: List[int], cost: List[List[int]], m: int, n: int, target: int) -> int:
	
        @lru_cache(None)        # this cache helps to do memoization/DP, by avoiding re-calculation on `dp`
        def dp(i, color, target):
            if houses[i] != 0 and houses[i] != color:
                # house is painted, we can\'t paint it by the `color`.
                return float(\'inf\')
            if target == 0:
                # it is impossible to construct 0 neighborhoods
                return float(\'inf\')
				
            # the cost to NEWLY paint this house
            my_cost = cost[i][color - 1] if houses[i] == 0 else 0
			
            if i == 0:
                # This is the base case of DP
                return my_cost if target == 1 else float(\'inf\')
				
            # The minimum cost to paint the houses[0 ... i - 1]
            other_cost = float(\'inf\')
			
            for next_color in range(1, n + 1):
                other_cost = min(other_cost, dp(i - 1, next_color, target - int(next_color != color)))    # if colors are same, do not decrease `target`, because i and i-1 are in the same neighborhood

            # Return the cost to paint house[i] + the minimum cost to paint houses[0... i - 1].
            # This gives the minimum cost to paint houses[0...i] under the two constraints mentioned above.
            return my_cost + other_cost
