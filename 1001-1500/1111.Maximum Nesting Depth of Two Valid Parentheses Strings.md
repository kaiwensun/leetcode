### To clarify the question

The split result is two subsequences, not necessarily two substrings. The difference between a subsequence and a substring is that a subsequence doesn\'t have to be continuous. For example, `"ABDG"` is not a substring of `"ABCDEFG"`, but it is a subsequence.

---

### Solution Analysis
Since we are spliting the original string into subsequences, we don\'t care whether they are continuous. As long as the resulting subsequences have their parentheses from the original string **in the original order**, that is good enough. To guarantee they are in the original order, we can simply scan from left to right once, and hopefully we can determine which (A or B) subsequence does the parenthesis belong to **right after we scan to it**. -- so we are looking for a greedy algorithm.

So can we determine it right away? Yes. Apart from keeping the origional order, the **only** other goal is to minimize the depth. That means, **to achieve this goal**, when we see a `"("` we should allocate it to the subsequence with less unmatched `"("`; when we see a `")"`, we should allocate it to the subsequence with more unmatched `"("`.

### Code [Python]
```
class Solution(object):
    def maxDepthAfterSplit(self, seq):
        res = [None] * len(seq)
        A = B = 0
        for i, c in enumerate(seq):
            if c == \'(\':
                if A <= B:
                    A += 1
                    res[i] = 0
                else:
                    B += 1
                    res[i] = 1
            else:
                if A >= B:
                    A -= 1
                    res[i] = 0
                else:
                    B -= 1
                    res[i] = 1
        return res
```
