### Question analysis
The question is composed of two requirements:
- To remove a node, the child need to **notify** its parent about the child\'s existance.
- To determine whether a node is a root node in the final forest, we need to know [1] whether the node is removed (which is trivial), and [2] whether its parent is removed (which requires the parent to **notify** the child)

It is very obvious that a tree problem is likely to be solved by recursion. The two components above are actually examining interviewees\' understanding to the two key points of **recursion**:
- passing info downwards -- by arguments
- passing info upwards -- by return value

### Fun fact
I\'ve seen this question in 2016 at a real newgrad interview. It was asked by a very well-known company and was a publicly known question at that time. I highly doubt that the company will ask this question again nowadays.

### Code [Python]

```
class Solution(object):
    def delNodes(self, root, to_delete):
        to_delete = set(to_delete)
        res = []
        def walk(root, parent_exist):
            if root is None:
                return None
            if root.val in to_delete:
                root.left = walk(root.left, parent_exist=False)
                root.right = walk(root.right, parent_exist=False)
                return None
            else:
                if not parent_exist:
                    res.append(root)
                root.left = walk(root.left, parent_exist=True)
                root.right = walk(root.right, parent_exist=True)
                return root
        walk(root, parent_exist=False)
        return res
```
