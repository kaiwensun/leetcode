The Python3 code should explain itself. When it doesn\'t, check if the notes at the end helps.

If you don\'t understand anything here, please ask. **Down voting won\'t help you** to understand.

# **Python3 Code**

```
from functools import lru_cache
class Solution:
    def getMaxGridHappiness(self, m: int, n: int, introvertsCount: int, extrovertsCount: int) -> int:
        INTRO, EXTRO, LOSS, GAIN = 120, 40, -30, 20
        INITIAL = {
            " ": 0,
            "i": INTRO,
            "e": EXTRO
        }

        # on top of the initial happiness of c1 and c2, what\'s the additional happiness change if c1 and c2 are neighbors.
        def getAdjustedHappiness(c1, c2):
            c1, c2 = sorted([c1, c2])  # sort c1 c2 based on the order of [" ", "e", "i"], so that the following calculation can be simpler.
            if c1 == " ":
                return 0
            if c1 == "e":
                if c2 == "e": return GAIN + GAIN
                if c2 == "i": return GAIN + LOSS
            if c1 == "i":
                return LOSS + LOSS
            assert(False)

        # dp returns the max happiness we can get from (0, 0) to (i, j)
        @lru_cache(None)
        def dp(visible_row, i, j, introvertsCount, extrovertsCount):
            if introvertsCount == extrovertsCount == 0 or i < 0:
                return 0

            availables = [" "]    # possible values we can put in this cell, based on introvertsCount and extrovertsCount
            if introvertsCount: availables.append("i")
            if extrovertsCount: availables.append("e")

            res = 0
            visible_row = list(visible_row)
            for value in availables:
                cur_res = INITIAL[value] + getAdjustedHappiness(value, visible_row[j]) + getAdjustedHappiness(value, visible_row[j + 1])
                tmp, visible_row[j] = visible_row[j], value
                cur_res += dp(tuple(visible_row), i + ((j - 1) // n), (j - 1) % n, introvertsCount - int(value == "i"), extrovertsCount - int(value == "e"))
                visible_row[j] = tmp
                res = max(res, cur_res)
            return res

        return dp(" " * (n + 1), m - 1, n - 1, introvertsCount, extrovertsCount)

# **Notes** (read only when needed)

* `i`, `j` are cell index in the grid
* Fill the grid from the last row to the first row; fill each row from right to left.
* `visible_row` is a top view of the grid. For example , if the 4x6 grid is filled like (use `.` to represent cell that we\'ve decided not to put any person in):
  ```
  [      ]
  [  ie..]
  [e.eee.]
  [ii..ei]
  ```
  then the `visible_row` of this state is `[e.ie..]`. the `e.` is from the row `[e.eeei]`, the `ie..` is from the row `[  ie..]`.
* When we fill one cell `c`, we need to find the `AdjustedHappiness` between `c` and the cell below `c`, as well as the `AdjustedHappiness` between `c` and the cell right to `c`. So when we initialize `visible_row`, we make its length to be `m + 1`. The `+1` is for the convenience of calculating the `AdjustedHappiness` when `c` is the right-most cell.
* `i + ((j - 1) // n)`, `(j - 1) % n`: This is just calculating the next `i` and `j`. When `j == 0`, the next cell is in another row.
* `@lru_cache(None)`: this is a Python3 syntax sugar to cache the result for the given arguments of `dp`. Next time when the same arguments are given, the result is immediately returned.
* `tuple` is to make visible_row hashable (required by lru_cache). `list` is to make visible_row mutable.
